# Asana Parent Ticket Highlighter

The Asana Parent Ticket Highlighter is a lightweight Chrome extension designed to enhance your experience with Asana by prominently displaying the parent ticket name in the ticket list view. This allows for better visibility and helps with prioritizing tasks within a larger project or epic.

## What Does it Do?

The extension works by embedding the parent ticket name directly into the ticket list view in Asana. This addresses a common issue where the parent ticket name, which is normally displayed in a subtle grey text to the right of the ticket name, is not easily noticeable. In instances where the ticket name is lengthy, the parent ticket name may not be displayed at all, leaving no indication of its existence.

This extension aims to solve this issue by populating a user-defined column with the parent ticket name, making it a more prominent part of your Asana view.

2. Click the extension icon in your browser to open the settings. Make sure the name of the custom field you created matches with the "Column Name" setting in the extension.

3. Once done, the parent ticket name will be automatically populated in the column you created, thereby enhancing visibility.

## Why This Extension?

Asana displays the parent ticket name next to the task name in a subtle gray text.

However, this information can easily be overlooked. In cases where the task name is too long, the parent ticket name might not be displayed at all.

These issues become especially problematic when managing larger projects or epics, where understanding the hierarchy of tasks is important for prioritization.
